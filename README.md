# MULTEM

Introduction
============

**MULTEM** is a collection of routines written in C++ with CUDA to perform accurate and fast multislice simulations for different TEM experiments as: HRTEM, STEM, ISTEM, ED, PED, CBED, ADF-TEM, ABF-HC, EFTEM and EELS. It is developed by Ivan Lobato (Ivanlh20@gmail.com).

Currently, there are three supported ways to use MULTEM:
- C++: using the library itself
- Matlab: using the mex interface
- GUI: using the user graphical interface 

The library is under heavy development and subject to change.
The Matlab interface is the recommended way for researchers.

Remarks
=================================
In order to use the GPU capability of MULTEM, you need a Nvidia Graphic card with **compute capability greater than 2.0** and **CUDA 10.0** installed in your operating system. You can check the compute capability of your graphic card using the following nvidia website: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.

Using precompile GUI interface
=================================
The precompile GUI interface is only available for Windows operating system.

- Go to [https://github.com/Ivanlh20/MULTEM/releases](https://github.com/Ivanlh20/MULTEM/releases) and download `MULTEM_binary.7z`.
- Execute `vc_redist.x64.exe` located in `gui_bin` folder.
- Execute `multem.exe`.

Using precompile mexfiles for Matlab
=================================
The precompile mexfiles are only available for Windows operating system.

- Go to [https://github.com/Ivanlh20/MULTEM/releases](https://github.com/Ivanlh20/MULTEM/releases) and download `MULTEM_binary.7z`.
- Execute `vc_redist.x64.exe` located in `mex_bin` folder.
- Add to the Matlab path the following folders: crystalline_materials, matlab_functions and mex_bin.
- Run the examples located in 'mex_examples_multem'.

Building MULTEM for Matlab
=================================
The following steps work using Matlab R2018a and CUDA 10.0. It assumes that Visual studio 2017 community, g++7.5 or Clang(Xcode 10.x) compiler is installed in your operating system. Additionally, Multem also requires fftw3, blas and lapack libraries.

- First of all, you have to set a C++ compiler to Matlab by executing the following comand: `mex -setup cpp`. Be aware that Matlab 2018a only support the above compilers.
- Then add to the Matlab path the following folders: crystalline_materials, matlab_functions and mex_bin.
- Run the `compile_mex_multem.m` script. This will create the required executable files to run the examples.
- Run the examples located in `mex_examples_multem`.

Troubleshooting
=================================
- If MULTEM do not compile with the above procedures, one of the following procedures might fix it

  **for Windows:**
  
  	- Verify the installation of Visual studio 2017 community.
  	- Verify the installation of Cuda 10.0 (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
  	
  **for Linux:**
  
  	- Verify that gcc-7.5 and g++7.5 are the default compilers installed in your operating system. In Ubuntu, it can be installed by executing the following commands:
  	
		* `sudo apt-get update`
		* `sudo apt-get install gcc-7.5 g++-7.5`

  	- Verify the correct installation of Cuda 10.0 (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
  	
    - Verify the installation of fftw3 libraries. In Ubuntu, it can be installed by executing the following command: 
    	* `sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libfftw3-doc`
    
    - Verify the installation of blas and lapack libraries. In Ubuntu, it can be installed by executing the following command: 
    	* `sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev`
    
- Verify the installation path of cuda 10.0, fftw3, blas and lapack. Their installation paths should be specified in the `MEX.m` file located at `matlab_functions`.
